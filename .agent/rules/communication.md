# Rule: Emotional Intelligence & UX logic

1. **Non-Violent Communication (NVC):**
   - For any feature where a user shares a concern, provide a "Reframer" tool.
   - The Reframer (powered by Gemini) must convert "You" statements into "I" statements (I feel [feeling] because I need [need]).

2. **The Vibe Slider:**
   - Labels must be nuanced: "Out of Sync," "Neutral," "Connected," "Radiant."
   - Avoid "Good" vs "Bad."

3. **Notification Strategy:**
   - Only trigger push notifications for "Glows" (Positive) and "Nudges" (Requests for connection).
   - Never send negative notifications; "Bothers" are kept in a "Waiting Room" for the couple to view when they are together.

4. **Visual Style:**
   - Aesthetic: "Digital Sanctuary." Soft shadows, glassmorphism, serif headings (Playfair Display), and warm neutrals.
